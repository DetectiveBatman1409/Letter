        <p>This is an interactive letter and story of Sahil and Sanya. Read on to find out more.</p>

          Mumbai was never a city of quiet moments. Between the rush of local trains and the endless honking of taxis, Sahil met Sanya in college—not just through random classes, but through a club they had both impulsively joined.
        </p>
        <p>
          It started with casual conversations during meetings, playful banter, and brainstorming sessions for events. Somewhere between debating over theme ideas and pulling off last-minute fixes, their friendship deepened.

          Sanya was the kind of person who could turn a mundane task into an adventure, slipping in witty remarks between serious discussions. 
        </p>
        <p>
          Sahil, on the other hand, was quieter—observant, thoughtful, someone who carried his emotions like a well-kept secret. But somehow, with her, words came easily.
        </p>

        <p>
          Their friendship grew in stolen moments—laughing over bad canteen food, late-night assignment panic, and shared walks along the campus corridors. Somewhere between all of it, Sahil found himself drawn to her in a way that went beyond friendship.
        </p>
        <p>
          It wasn’t just her infectious energy or the way he could talk with her—it was the way she saw him, really understand him, in a way no one else ever had.

          One evening, as they sat on the steps of their college library watching the city lights flicker in the distance, he finally said it. "Sanya, I think I love you."
        </p>
        <p>
          She turned to him, her smile soft but knowing. "Sahil... I like what we have. I like us. But not in the way you do.".
          The words landed gently, but they still cut. He chuckled, trying to mask the sting. “So, you’re telling me I survived three years of engineering math just to get friend-zoned?”
        </p>

          She rolled her eyes, nudging him with her shoulder. “Shut up, Sahil.” 
          And so, he stayed with her as a friend, even if it wasn’t the love he wanted.
        </p>
        <p>
         Years passed. Sanya fell in and out of relationships. Sahil tried to move on in his own way— went out with few people, hoping to find something that felt right. But something was always missing.
        </p>
        <div class="nav-buttons">

      <!-- Page 7 -->
      <div class="page page7">
        <p>
         Conversations felt forced, laughter didn’t come as easily, and every now and then, in the quiet moments, his mind would drift back to her. It wasn’t that he compared, but rather that nothing ever made sense the way it did with Sanya.
        </p>
        <p>
          And every time he saw her with someone else, it felt like he was watching a story unfold where he was never meant to be the protagonist.
        </p>
        <div class="nav-buttons">
          <label class="button" for="page6">⬅️ Back</label>

          Slowly, he started stepping back—replying less, calling less, until eventually, the silence between them grew too loud to ignore. He had to distance himself from her to repeat this endless cycle of falling for her, over and over.
        </p>
        <p>
          Then, fate intervened. Two years later, they met again—at a close friend’s wedding. The venue was decorated in golden lights, laughter and music filling the air. Sanya stood by the counter, looking effortlessly radiant.
        </p>
        <div class="nav-buttons">

      <!-- Page 9 -->
      <div class="page page9">
        <p>
          Their eyes met across the room, and just like that, it all came rushing back. The laughter, the longing, the ache of wanting something he could never quite have.
        </p>
        <p>
          “Sahil,” she greeted, her voice carrying that same warmth. “You look… the same.”
          He smirked. “Well, I tried moving on, but turns out, good barbers are harder to find than love.”

        <p>
          She laughed, shaking her head. The conversation flowed like it always had—effortless, familiar, as if the distance between them had never existed.
        </p>
        <p>
          But Sahil knew better. Distance had been necessary. It was the only thing that helped him move on. Or did he move on?

          And yet, as the night went on, as they talked and let nostalgia take over, he realized something—he was still drawn to her. The question was, had he changed? Had she?
        </p>
        <p>
          Did he still love her? He thought he had moved on, but why's he still drawn to her? He was not sure anymore. He didn't even know her anymore. He lover her when he knew her but what's this now? He does not really know her anymore like he used to.

      <div class="page page12">
        <p>
          So, before the night ended, before they could slip back into another cycle of unfinished stories, he finally asked:
          "Sanya, what if we try something new? No labels to our relationship, no pressure—just a journey. You love traveling, don’t you? Let’s see where this takes us. Will you go on this journey with me to explore if there's a potential for something to happen between us?”

        She looked at him, eyes full of something unreadable. Outside, the rain threatened to fall, the clouds heavy with promise.
        </p>
        <p>
        Would this be a new beginning? Or just another chapter in their cycle?
        No one knew, except for maybe, Sanya.
        And so, with Mumbai’s monsoon as their silent witness, their story hung in delicate balance—an ending left open, waiting for time to decide what came next.
