          This is a story about two people - Sahil and Sanya.
          Mumbai was never a city of quiet moments. Between the rush of local trains and the endless honking of taxis, Sahil met Sanya in college‚Äînot just through random classes, but through a club they had both impulsively joined. 
        </p>
        <p>
          It started with casual conversations during meetings, playful banter, and brainstorming sessions for events. Somewhere between debating over theme ideas and pulling off last-minute fixes, their friendship deepened.

          Sanya was the kind of person who could turn a mundane task into an adventure, slipping in witty remarks between serious discussions. 
        </p>
        <p>
          Sahil, on the other hand, was quieter‚Äîobservant, thoughtful, someone who carried his emotions like a well-kept secret. But somehow, with her, words came easily.

        <p>
          Their friendship grew in stolen moments‚Äîlaughing over bad canteen food, late-night assignment panic, and shared walks along the campus corridors. Somewhere between all of it, Sahil found himself drawn to her in a way that went beyond friendship.
        </p>
        <p>
          It wasn‚Äôt just her infectious energy or the way he could talk with her‚Äîit was the way she saw him, really understand him, in a way no one else ever had.

        <p>
          One evening, as they sat on the steps of their college library watching the city lights flicker in the distance, he finally said it. "Sanya, I think I love you."
        </p>
        <p>
          She turned to him, her smile soft but knowing. "Sahil... I like what we have. I like us. But not in the way you do."

          The words landed gently, but they still cut. He chuckled, trying to mask the sting. ‚ÄúSo, you‚Äôre telling me I survived three years of engineering math just to get friend-zoned?‚Äù
        </p>
        <p>
          She rolled her eyes, nudging him with her shoulder. ‚ÄúShut up, Sahil.‚Äù And so, he stayed with her as a friend. Because even if it wasn‚Äôt the love he wanted, he wanted her to be happy.

          Years passed. Sanya fell in and out of relationships. Sahil tried to move on in his own way‚Äî went out with few people, hoping to find something that felt right. But something was always missing.
        </p>
        <p>
          Conversations felt forced, laughter didn‚Äôt come as easily, and every now and then, in the quiet moments, his mind would drift back to her. It wasn‚Äôt that he compared, but rather that nothing ever made sense the way it did with Sanya.

          And every time he saw her with someone else, it felt like he was watching a story unfold where he was never meant to be the protagonist. 
        </p>
        <p>
          Slowly, he started stepping back‚Äîreplying less, calling less, until eventually, the silence between them grew too loud to ignore. He had to distance himself from her to repeat this endless cycle of falling for her, over and over.
