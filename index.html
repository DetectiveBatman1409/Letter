        <p>
          Mumbai was never a city of quiet moments. Between the rush of local trains and the endless honking of taxis, Sahil met Sanya in college—not just through random classes, but through a club they had both impulsively joined.
        </p>
        <p>
          It started with casual conversations during meetings, playful banter, and brainstorming sessions for events. Somewhere between debating over theme ideas and pulling off last-minute fixes, their friendship deepened.

          Sanya was the kind of person who could turn a mundane task into an adventure, slipping in witty remarks between serious discussions. 
        </p>
        <p>
          Sahil, on the other hand, was quieter—observant, thoughtful, someone who carried his emotions like a well-kept secret. But somehow, with her, words came easily.

          💖 Their friendship blossomed in stolen moments – laughing over bad canteen food, late-night assignment panic, and shared walks along campus corridors.
        </p>
        <p>
          🌃 One evening, on the steps of their college library as city lights flickered in the distance, Sahil finally said, "Sanya, I think I love you." She replied softly, "Sahil, I like what we have. I like us. But not in the way you do."

          ⏳ Years passed. Sanya fell in and out of relationships, while Sahil tried to move on – going out with a few people, hoping to find that elusive spark.
        </p>
        <p>
          💔 Yet every time he saw her with someone else, it felt as though he was watching a story unfold in which he was never the protagonist. The silence between them grew too loud to ignore.

        <p>
          🔇 Slowly, Sahil began to distance himself – replying less, calling less – until the gap between them became too vast. He needed to break the endless cycle of falling for her.
        </p>
        <p>
          🎉 Then fate intervened. Two years later, at a close friend’s wedding, they met again. Sanya stood radiant, catching his gaze from across the room.

          😊 "Sahil," she said warmly, "you look the same." He replied with a joke about how good barbers were hard to find, yet beneath the humor lay unspoken truths.
        </p>
        <p>
          As the evening wore on, nostalgia and reflection took hold. Sahil questioned if he had truly moved on, or if he was still drawn to the memory of their past.

          🤔 With a heavy heart, he finally asked, "Sanya, what if we try something new? No labels, no pressure – just a journey. You love traveling, don’t you? Let’s see where this takes us."
        </p>
        <p>
          Would this be a new beginning or just another chapter in their cycle? Only time could tell.
